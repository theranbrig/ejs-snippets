# EJS Snippets README

This is a basic snippet library for EJS files. EJS can be very useful when used for templating, but it tends to be pretty tedious to write out. I made my own library of snippets in order to make it easier to use and faster to write. Please let me know if there are issues with the snippets or other ones that could be built. As of now I just have the basics but could add in others if requested

## Features

**Snippets are found below.**

- `ejs` => `<% %>`
- `ejsout` => `<%= %>`
- `ejsesc` => `<%- %>`
- `ejscom` => `<%# %>`
- `ejslit` => `<%% %>`
- `ejsinc` => `ejs include statement`
- `ejsfor` => `ejs for loop`
- `ejsfe` => `ejs forEach loop`
- `ejsif` => `ejs if statement`
- `ejselif` => `ejs else if statement` - Middle section only. Assumes you have already written the first if statement.
